# ðŸ“± Device Info & Sensor App â€” Flutter + BLoC + Clean Architecture

A Flutter application that demonstrates:
- Device Information fetching (Battery %, Device Name, OS Version),
- Sensor Data (Gyroscope),
- Flashlight Toggle,
- Native Android/iOS Integration via MethodChannels,
- State Management with BLoC,
- Lottie animations for loading states,
- Unit Testing using bloc_test and mockito,
- Clean architecture (Domain, Data, Presentation layers).

## Features

### Dashboard Screen:
- ðŸ“± Displays Device Name, OS Version
- ðŸ”‹ Battery Percentage fetched from Native Code
- Auto-loads info on screen open
- Refresh via button

### Sensor Screen:
- ðŸ“Œ Gyroscope Data (X, Y, Z values) auto-loaded on open
- ðŸ”¦ Flashlight toggle using Native Method Channel
- Clean state management with BLoC
- Centered buttons with refresh option
